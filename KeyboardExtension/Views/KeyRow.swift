import SwiftUI

// KeyRow is defined in KeyboardView.swift to have access to KeyboardState
// This file is kept for organizational purposes but the main implementation
// is in KeyboardView.swift

// If you need to extract KeyRow to its own file, you would need to:
// 1. Import the KeyboardState class
// 2. Move the KeyRow struct here

// For now, this file serves as a placeholder for future refactoring
// if the keyboard layout becomes more complex.
